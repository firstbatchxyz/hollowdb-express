# HollowDB Backend - ExpressJS (Hiring)

HollowDB backend using ExpressJS. This project is intended for our hiring case and includes a built-in wallet and contract in this branch to simplify the setup. You no longer need to generate an Arweave wallet and deploy a contract. Just install the required packages and start the server.

> [!WARNING]
> For hiring purposes, we have included an Arweave wallet JWK in this repository. Do not send any tokens to this wallet, as it is not secure.
